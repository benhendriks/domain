            <p>
              Welcome to my website, where I’ll be sharing my (ongoing) experience
              of going zero.
              <br/>

              <h3 className="about-highlight">zero plastic, zero waste, zero bad vibes, …</h3>
              <br/>
              Going zero is not one single, big overnight change, but consists
              of many little baby steps concerning changes ranging from food to
              clothing, packaging, “beauty products” etc.
              <br/>

              How did I get started, you might wonder?
              Well, almost 1.5 years ago, I made the decision to eat fewer dairy
              products. Then I decided to try to avoid buying things that come
              in plastic packaging. A few months later, another decision followed:
              making my own deodorant... So slowly but steadily I changed my habits
              and products I use. There are always new things to try and to change.
              So, I'm curious to see where this journey will take me next!
              The changes I’ve made so far don’t feel like drastic changes, but
              every little change adds to the bigger picture of living a more
              sustainable life. Basically, it all started with one little decision
              and then one thing led to another.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And I’m happy to say that throughout my journey I stayed 100% fluffy
              - happy, comfortable, and cosy!
              <br/>

              I hope of encouraging you to take
              a step towards a cleaner future, I created this website. Nobody is
              perfect – me included – and you shouldn’t feel pressured to change
              all your habits and routines overnight. But every little effort helps!
              Please, join me and everyone who is already on this journey and
              hopefully get inspired to start your own!
              Stay fluffy,
              Regula
